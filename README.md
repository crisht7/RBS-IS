# RBS-IS
This program implements a **backward chaining inference engine** for a **rule-based expert system**. It processes a **Knowledge Base (BC)** and a **Fact Base (BH)** to determine the certainty factor (FC) of a given objective. The system applies logical inference using predefined rules, certainty factors, and logical operators (`and`, `or`).
